# Hack Technology / Project Attempted


## What you built? 

A chrome extension that enables a user to change a given word or phrase on a webpage to a different word or phrase. 

For example - a user could change an instance of the phrase "stock market" on the New York Times home page to the phrase "cryptocurrency lottery."

We were not successful - after 5+ tutorials on relevant problems and 10+ hours of coding/iterating, we dropped it out of frustration.

Include some screenshots.

## Who Did What?

Grant - initial setup of chrome extension, popup logic, proof of concept (swapping hardcoded phrases)

Jack - javascript / eventListener logic, communication between html and script


## What you learned

Coding in pure javascript is really, really annoying. I will probably not attempt it again. JS tutorials that worked five years ago may not work today, and pure JS is both hard to debug and understand if all you have used previously are JS frameworks.
